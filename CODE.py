#In this example, we use the NLTK library to build a simple rule-based chatbot. The `pairs` list contains patterns and corresponding responses. The `Chat` class from `nltk.chat.util` handles the conversation based on these patterns.

#To use this code, you'll need to install NLTK and download the required data by running `nltk.download('punkt')`. Once you have the code ready, you can create a new repository on GitHub and add this file to it. Make sure to include a README file with instructions on how to run the chatbot and any other relevant details.

#This chatbot is a basic example, and you can enhance it by adding more patterns and responses, incorporating more advanced natural language processing techniques, and integrating it with other APIs or services.

#Remember to customize the code and add your personal touch to make it unique. Happy coding!
